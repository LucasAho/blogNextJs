                <p>
                    After the human race attempted to transcend to the Hestafan plane in the first rift, Hestafa dispersed the race of humanity across the universe and cut them from the technology they had grown reliant on. 
                    On the planet of Maalima, this new dark age of technology and separation of cultures led to the eventual speciation of 4 new descendants of humanity.
